# Sorting Algorithms Visualisation

This project is using React with no backend implemented

## Description

WORK IN PROGRESS

This project allows for the user to set the bar chart and sort them using algorithms such as Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quicksort, Counting Sort.
User can set a range of numbers used to represent chart values.
User can set number of columns from 1 to 100.
user can determine if the numbers will repeat when number of columns is less or equal to the number of set range.


## Backlog

The repeat number capabilities is not yet developed.

Currently only insertion sort is fully functional.


## Notes

There are no plans to develop backend or any support that will allow to store the session data.
